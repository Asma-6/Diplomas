# The frontend
This part was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In this app directory, you can run either :

### `yarn start`

To run the app in the development mode.\
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

or : 

### `serve -s build`
To run the app in the production mode (this mode is used while deploying the react app. It helps in optimizing performance).\
Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
