This repo contains 2 branches :
* In the master branch : there are the files of the backend of the app.
* In the react branch : there are the files of the frontend of the app.

# The backend 
It's about an API application made by Laravel 8, which is a server-side PHP framework.

To run this app :

1- Import the database file Suividiplomes.sql

2- run this command : Php artisan serv
